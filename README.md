# 3DUIS: 3D Unsupervised Instance Segmentation

This repo contains the code for our [paper](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/pdfs/nunes2022ral-iros.pdf): Unsupervised Class-Agnostic Instance
Segmentation of 3D LiDAR Data for Autonomous Vehicles.

Our approach uses a self-supervised pretrained network to extract point-wise features and use it to build a graph representation of the point cloud,
mapping the relation between each point and it's neighbors. Then, we apply GraphCut to divide each instance from the background, achieving class-agnostic
instance segmentation in an unsupervised manner.

Additionally, we created a new benchmark for Open-World LiDAR instance segmentation based on SemanticKITTI [here](https://bit.ly/39VFTRD).

## Dependencies

Installing pre-requisites:

`sudo apt install build-essential python3-dev libopenblas-dev`

`pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

Next install MinkowskiEngine:

`pip3 install -U git+https://github.com/NVIDIA/MinkowskiEngine --install-option="--blas=openblas" -v --no-deps`

## Data preparation

Download [SemanticKITTI](http://www.semantic-kitti.org/dataset.html#download) inside the directory ```./Datasets/SemanticKITTI/datasets```. The directory structure should be:

```
./
└── Datasets/
    └── SemanticKITTI
        └── dataset
          └── sequences
            ├── 00/           
            │   ├── velodyne/	
            |   |	├── 000000.bin
            |   |	├── 000001.bin
            |   |	└── ...
            │   └── labels/ 
            |       ├── 000000.label
            |       ├── 000001.label
            |       └── ...
            ├── 08/ # for validation
            ├── 11/ # 11-21 for testing
            └── 21/
                └── ...
```

For the unsupervised ground segmentation, you need to run [patchwork](https://github.com/LimHyungTae/patchwork) over the SemanticKITTI dataset and put the generated files over:
```
./
└── Datasets/
    └── SemanticKITTI
        └── assets
            └── patchwork   
                ├── 08
                    ├── 000000.label
                    ├── 000001.label
                    └── ...
```

For the validation set (sequence 08) you can download the patchwork ground segmentation [here](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/3duis/08_patchwork.zip) and extract as described above.

## Pretrained weights

You can download [here](https://www.ipb.uni-bonn.de/html/projects/segcontrast/segcontrast_pretrain.zip) the network weights pretrained with [SegContrast](https://github.com/PRBonn/segcontrast) , and it should be extracted inside `./checkpoints`.

## Running the code

To extract the instances run:

`python3 3duis.py`

(In the repo we have one example point cloud that you can run to see the results and check if the setup is working)

The predicted instance segmentation should be saved in `outputs/3DUIS/`

To visualize it run:

`python3 vis_inst.py`
